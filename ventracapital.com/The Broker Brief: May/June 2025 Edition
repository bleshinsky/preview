      <h2>📰 ATO Debt Crackdown Intensifies: Brokers Must Act Swiftly</h2>
      <p>As the end of financial year nears, thousands of Australian businesses are feeling the pressure—not just from accountants, but from the ATO itself. In the first half of 2025, ATO enforcement activity surged, with insolvency appointments up 47% year-on-year, driven largely by unpaid PAYG and GST debts.</p>
      <p>From July 1, 2025, interest on overdue tax debt will no longer be tax-deductible, making delays in payment even more costly. Clients with tax debts over $100,000 and more than 90 days overdue are at serious risk of garnishee notices, director penalty notices, and credit reporting actions.</p>
      <p>Second mortgages are becoming the go-to strategy for brokers working with clients in urgent need of capital to clear tax liabilities without refinancing their entire loan structure. Ventra Capital Private provides the speed, flexibility, and structure required to avoid enforcement while protecting business continuity.</p>

      <h2>⚡ Broker Intel – 3 Signs Your Client Needs This Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>They mention overdue PAYG, GST or BAS.</li>
        <li>They’ve received ATO letters, payment demands, or DPN threats.</li>
        <li>They're reluctant to refinance their existing home loan just to pay a tax bill.</li>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>💬 Broker Q&A – What If the ATO Has Already Issued a Notice?</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you still help if the client has received a DPN or garnishee warning?<br>
         <strong>✅ VCP Answer:</strong> Yes, if equity exists, we can move quickly—often before the ATO enforces. We prioritise urgent tax debt settlements and can structure around tight timelines.</p>

      <p>May and June are historically the busiest months for tax debt settlements—and this year, ATO activity is well above pre-pandemic levels. Brokers who act fast can prevent clients from slipping into irreversible enforcement territory.</p>
